## Hello! 🙋‍♂️ I’m Storm Holloway. Although my handle is RagingBigDog 🐩. 

## ✨ About me

🎓 I have a B.S. in IT with a focus in cybersecurity and information assurance. Currently looking for a job in my field to gain more experience as I currently am depot staff for a newspaper distribution warehouse.

📜 I have a little knowledge in quite a few different areas such as Python, JS, SQL, Azure, AWS, Linux (primarily Debian-based Distros), Windows OS, VSC, and Github. Am currently working on increasing my knowledge of Python and building a Discord bot using it. 

🎧 Outside of the IT world, I enjoy learning new skills, and improving them, ranging from guitar, writing music, animating, and fantasy football, as well as playing board and video games (though only aiming to master guitar and animating).

🤝 I am willing to collaborate on anything.
